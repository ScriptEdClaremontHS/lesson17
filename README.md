# Lesson 17 - ID Selectors

## Do Now:

### Warm Up:

First, copy the following CSS rule into your notebooks.

```css
h3 {
    color: green;
    font-size: 17px;
}
```

Label the following parts of the rule:
* the selector
* all properties
* all values

### Nitrous setup

Open [nitrous.io](http://nitrous.io) and paste the following link into your terminal:

```
cd workspace/www; git clone https://github.com/ScriptEdClaremontHS/lesson17.git;
```

Don't forget to hit enter after!

### Bonus

If you finish early, first, create a page with a corresponding
stylesheet using the `<link>` tag.

Add whatever elements you want to the page (probably at least 5 or 6). Then in your style sheet, use each of the following properties at least once. Feel free to Google
any of the ones you haven't seen before.

* `text-shadow`
* `background`
* `border`
* `margin`
* `padding`
* `tranform`
* `border-image` (you'll need an image for this one)

If you finish with that, go to NYTimes.com, right click the page and click "view source".

Look at the HTML, and write down 5 tags that NYTimes uses that we haven't learned yet.
Google each one and see what they do.
